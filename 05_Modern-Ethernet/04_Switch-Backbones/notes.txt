Switch Backbones: 
    Free us from daisy chain
        -also free from entire network problems due to one cable going bad.
    many different speeds within the same network. 
    High Speed switch in the middle
        feeding multiple outlying switches feeding the outer lower speed networks from there

    "GBIC (Gigabit Interface Converter)"
        -designed to move in/out of switches, so that the network can talk to just about anyone. 
        "Bridge Loop (BLoop)":
            Problems: 
                whole network goes down
                Spanning Tree Protocol:
                    -prevents BLoop 
                    -will turn off one of thier ports
