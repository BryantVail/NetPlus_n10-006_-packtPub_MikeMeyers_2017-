Modern Ethernet Switches and Duplex:
    100BaseT
    100BaseTX (the same as above)
        100 mbps
        1024 nodes per hub
        100 meters between hun & client
        cat5e or better 
    100BaseFX (F)
        1024 nodes/hub
        multi-Mode
        2 Kilometers
    
    Duplex Switching: 
        switch:
            monitors each port & knows which mac belongs to each port. 
            only sends to which part the frame is assigned to
            broadcast(to each port):
                sends out to all other ports 
            Dramatically improves performance on a network
            point to point 
    Half Duplex:
        Crossover cable between 2 PCs may require 'half-duplex'
