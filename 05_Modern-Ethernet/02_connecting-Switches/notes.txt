Connecting Switches: 
    Making One Big Switch out of Two
    Patch Cables: 
        Either 568A or 568B on both ends
        Crossover:
            568A with 568B
            Sends go to receive, receive goes to send. 
            use:
                simple:
                    plug into any port on both switches 
                complicated:
                    uplink (pre-crossover): use a straight through cable (not crossover) & the "uplink" port does it for us.
