Troubleshooting Structured Cabling part2
    "MDF (Main Distribution Frame)":
        -all vs individual
    "Electricity":
        -Voltage meter
            ex: when all elevators turn on & the system goes down 
    "Environmental/Temperature Monitor":
    "Horizontal Run":
        -leave it alone
        -TDR: should be able to verify with length
        -interference: 
            a) cable is often installed before all renovations are done
            b) new A/C system 
            c) certain times of day 
    "Modal Distortion":
        -Light travels in different modes
        -how the light bounces
        -ONLY Multi-Mode 
    
    ***Always look at the work area first!***
