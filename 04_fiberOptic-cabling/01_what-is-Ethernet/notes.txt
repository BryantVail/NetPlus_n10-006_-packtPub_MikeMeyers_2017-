what is Ethernet
    definition: 
        February 1980:
            IEEE 802.3/ Ethernet 
                cables
                speed
                type of frame
                sense & comm
    Frame: 
        stayed the same virtually
        Lives on MAC
        FCS (Frame Check Sequence)
        frame <= ~1500 bytes
        backward compatible bc the frame never changes
    Ethernet is the frame
    Nomenclature: 
        example: 10Base5
            "10" :          speed in MBPS
            "Base/Broad":   
                broad:      channels
                Base:       1 channel 
            "5":            500 meters
                -will usually show "T" instead of a number
